#+Title: Orgmode templates for \Latex PDF export

This repository contains =Orgmode= article templates to be exported in \latex - PDF. The templates try to follow as much as possible the \Latex templates provided by the publishers.
These templates can be used to write scientific articles in =Orgmode= and then export documents ready for submissions.
* Wiley-Chemistry template
The [[https://github.com/ajgiuliani/orgmode-templates/blob/main/WileyChemistry-template/paper.org][paper.org]] is the =orgmode= template.
The \Latex templates may be downloaded from here: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15213773/homepage/authors
The `.eps` Wiley-VCH logo had to be exported to pdf to be inserted in the templates.
